# Ames Housing Dataset

## About the Dataset:
Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.
This dataset contains 81 features describing almost every ascpect of a house in Ames during the 2006-2010 dataframe. The dataset can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview).

## Goal:
The goal of this project is to create a Linear model, train on the data with the optimal parameters using a Grid Search and then evaluate the model's performance on data that has never seen before. 

In the real world, not every data set is machine learning ready, and we often need to perform data cleaning or try to produce more usable features. This repo includes 4 python notebooks. Three of them deal with data cleaning and the last one is devoted to the machine learning model. More specific:
  1) Part 01: Outliers Removal
  2) Part 02: Dealing with missing data 
  3) Part 03: Dealing with categorical data
  4) Part 04: Building the Linear Model
