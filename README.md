# Ames Housing Dataset

## About the Dataset:



#Goal:
The goal of this project is to create a Linear Regression model, train on the data with the optimal parameters using a Grid Search and then evaluate the model's performance on data that has never seen before. 

In the real world, not every data set is machine learning ready, and we often need to perform data cleaning or try to produce more usable features. This repo includes 4 python notebooks. Three of them deal with data cleaning and the last one is devoted to the machine learning model. More spesific:
  1) Part 01: Outliers Removal
  2) Part 02: Dealing with missing data
  3) Part 03: Dealing with categorical data
  4) Part 04: Building the Linear Model
